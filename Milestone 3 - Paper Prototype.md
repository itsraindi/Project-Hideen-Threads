# 1. Describe clearly what aspect of your game you are testing and why?

 - We used a physical (“paper”) prototype to test our level design, specifically the intended path of progression—the sequence of clues, interactable objects, and items that a player must discover and use to reach the end of the level. We chose this because we were most unsure whether our planned clue/item flow would feel intuitive, engaging, and appropriately challenging before we invest time implementing it digitally.

 

# 2. How did you test it?

- We built a basic paper version of a one-level layout. The environment was represented with paper boundaries/rooms, and we used paper cut-outs (and/or small markers) to represent interactable objects, collectible items, and the player. During the test, one player moved through the layout step-by-step, choosing where to go and which objects to interact with. When the player “interacted” with an object, we revealed the associated clue or item (e.g., by handing them a slip of paper or flipping a card). We recorded at least one minute of this play session to document how the player navigated, what they tried first, and where they got stuck or felt unsure.

 

# 3. What did you learn from this test?
 
 - We learned that our initial layout was too simple to create a strong sense of intrigue. For the gameplay to feel compelling, our levels need more deliberate structure and complexity, including clearer clue dependencies, more meaningful decision points, and better pacing (not everything being found immediately).
 - We also realized that level design and progression planning will likely be the most complex part of development, because it requires balancing exploration, clarity, and challenge so players feel curious rather than confused.
