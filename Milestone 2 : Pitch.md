## 1) Game Summary (High Concept)
**Hidden Threads** is a 2D mystery game combining psychological tension and social media investigation.  
You investigate your friend’s murder by collecting evidence in the real world and uncovering hidden truths through social media.

---

## 2) What Makes the Game Unique
- A combination of **mystery + psychological tension + social media investigation**
- **Dual Investigation**: physical evidence + digital/social evidence
- A “watched” atmosphere (surveillance, pressure, uncertainty)

---

## 3) Player Role
You play as the missing/deceased friend’s **roommate / close friend**, acting as an investigator trying to piece together what happened.

---

## 4) Setting
- **Physical Setting:** friend’s room/college dorm (and related indoor areas)
- **Digital Setting:** social media pages + computer/phone interface

## Characters
- **Protagonist (You):** roommate/friend investigator, motivated by truth + grief
- **The Victim (Friend):** appears through posts/DMs/photos; key to mystery
- **Suspects:** 2–3 key people (classmate, coworker, ex, etc.)
- **Name of Character:** Harper, and her friend's name is Vera.  
## Settings (Planned)
- Dorm Room: primary evidence search space (objects, notes, devices)
- Hallway / Common Area: patrol pressure / CCTV terminals
- Social App Interface: feed, profile, DMs, group chats, timestamps

---

## 5) Core Objective
**Solve your friend’s murder** by investigating in both the real world and social media.

---

## 6) Core Gameplay Mechanics (Moment-to-Moment)
### Real World Investigation
- Move through small connected rooms to search for evidence
- Interact with objects (desk, locker, trash bin, CCTV console)
- Collect items (keycards, notes, USB drives)
- Hide or avoid being seen (closets, plants, vents) when necessary

### Social Media Investigation
- Read posts/comments/DMs/group chats
- Check profiles, follower networks, timestamps
- Identify contradictions and suspicious patterns

### Cross-Referencing Evidence
- Link clues together to progress:
  - match timestamps
  - match identities/aliases
  - verify authenticity (original vs edited/cropped)

### Quality-of-Life Systems
- Notes are automatically recorded on the player’s phone to recap what’s been found in the current level
- Optional: physical clue examples (sticky notes, USB drive with password hints)

---

## 7) Any Other Unique Features
- **Dual Investigation** (Real World vs Social Media)
- Evidence can exist in both forms (physical + digital)
- The “hidden dangers” of social media become gameplay, not just a story

---

## 8) Target Audience
- Teens / Young Adults (Gen Z)
- Social media users
- Players who enjoy mystery and psychological narrative games

---

## 9) Team Members & Roles
- **Alan** — Producer, Programming, Documentation / QA Testing
- **Divine** — Programming, UI/UX Assistance
- **Jenny** — Lead Designer, Digital Media
- **Mashhood** — Writer
- **Nate** — Level Design, Programming Assistance, Sound Assistance
- **Thomas** — Sound Design, Programming Assistance

---

## 10) Largest Development Risks (and Mitigation)
- **Content Volume:** be willing to simplify/cut content as needed; reuse templates for posts/DMs
- **UI/UX Complexity:** plan early (paper tests, mockups); simplify if needed
- **Level Design Scope:** keep maps small; avoid overcomplicated layouts
- **Playability & Clarity:** whitebox tests + frequent playtests

---

## 11) Social Media Theme Connection
The game explores the **hidden dangers and secrets of social media**—how online traces, posts, 
and private messages can reveal things even loved ones don’t know.
